### Hi there, I'm Paulo ðŸ‘‹


I live on Recife, Brazil and work at CESAR.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:  
- A large project with Angular and NodeJS with typescript and typeorm.
- Researching about a tool to recommend dashboards based on user's data, this will be my master thesis.
- A specialization in mobile dev apps: Android with Kotlin, iOS with Swift and Flutter with Dart.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- About data visualization.
- Although my current project is with Angular, I really likes React and your ecosystem.
